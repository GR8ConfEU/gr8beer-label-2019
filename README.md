# Beer Label "Competition" 

For many years, Gr8Conf has brewed custom beers for the participants.
And the beers have had custom labels, designed by the conference organisers (SÃ¸ren, actually).

This year, we will try to crowd source some of this!

Please submit your creative designs for beer labels and win immortal fame by having your design be the chosen one!

## Guidelines
The sky's the limit! As long as the sky fits on a beer bottle.

### Formats
Submissions must be designed to be printed on a 67 x 97 mm rectangular label, good quality (600 dpi). 
Thus, at least 1500x2300 pixels. Please submit in a common format (GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG). If we can't open it, we can't use it. 

Your design must include room for adding the alcohol percentage and the beer type (IPA, Lager, Ale etc).

### Content restrictions
Keep it safe-for-work. For the scope of this, Fortran is deemed safe-for-work. Cobol is an edge case.
Please don't use other people's copyrighted materials - the Gr8COnf logos are of course 


By submitting your design, you give Gr8Conf the legal rights to use it and/or modify it without any compensation to you. 
You still keep your copyright, but the conference can use it in any form. 

For inspiration, here's a gallery of some labels other brewers have made: https://brygselv.dk/etiketter/
(Some of these would *NOT* be acceptable under our restrictions) 
 
### How to submit

Clone the repo, add your label as a subfolder under the "labels" folder and make a pull request - e.g.
  "labels/My great design/MyLabel.png" and "labels/My great design/comments.md"

We will accept the pull request, unless it violates the guidelines. 

### Deadline
We must have your submission by May 1st - we will then choose a winner based on coolness, nerdiness, groovy relevance 
and whatever strikes our fancy. If there are a lot of submissions, we might even organize a quick vote.

We will use at least one of the submitted designs, but possibly more. The prize is yet to be determined, but may have a 
value of up to 1 Million Euro! 

(Note that being allowed to take an empty bottle home *may* have a value of *up to* 1 Million Euro, 
since it *may* end up as a collectors item - who knows?)

#But wait, there's more!


## Back labels

We will try to print back labels as well - smaller labels for the back of the bottle.
Feel free to submit anything here - code fragments, URLs of your favourite open source projects, groovy puzzlers, 
elevator pitch for your new Base64-based cryptocurrency, Star Wars quotes, ...
(Almost) anything goes.

We will try to get these printed individually and put randomly on the back of the bottles. So if we have 200 bottles and get 50 
submitted back labels, each will end up on four bottles.   

This is a bit experimental, so let's see how it goes. It may end up not happening if we run into printing issues.
To submit a back label, either tweet using the #Gr8beerBackLabel tag or make a push request to the "backlabels" directory.
The same format and content restrictions as above applies, but you don't need to make room for the alcohol percentage or
the type of beer. And to lower the confusion, try to not make it look like a beer label.  

# Ladies and Gentlemen, you may start your imaginations!
